# About MetaSLAM

MetaSLAM is a collective intelligence framework for multi-agent systems under large-scale and long-term opeartion, which includes the current cutting-edge **localization**, **mapping**, **exploration** approaches.
 MetaSLAM is also a joint organization to leverage the top researchers within **field robotics** domain, and extending the current boundaries for real-world robotic applications. We are combined with the top-researchers abround the world, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

## Our Abilities

MetaSLAM provides the following core approaches:

* **Multi-sensor Fusion based Localization and Navigation**
* **City-scale Map Merging**
* **Large-scale indoor Navigation**
* **Multi-agent Cooperation and Exploration**
* **Lifelong Perception and Navigation**

Based on the above abilities, we hope MetaSLAM can benefit for more researchers in different kinds of filed robotic areas.

## News

* <font color=#00BFFF>2023-08-01</font> We are hosting a [competition](https://metaslam.github.io/competitions/icra2023/) at IROS 2023 workshop [Closing the Loop on Localization](https://oravus.github.io/vpr-workshop/) with [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/), which aims at the application of place recognition in mapping merging systems or C-SLAM systems.

* <font color=#00BFFF>2023-07-31</font> Our paper "**BioSLAM: A Bio-inspired Lifelong Memory System for General Place
Recognition**" is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

* <font color=#00BFFF>2023-06-22</font> Our paper "**AutoMerge: A Framework for Map Assembling and Smoothing in City-scale
Environments**" is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics.
