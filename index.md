# About MetaSLAM

MetaSLAM is a collective intelligence framework for multi-agent systems under large-scale and long-term opeartion, which includes the current cutting-edge **localization**, **mapping**, **exploration** approaches.
 MetaSLAM is also a joint organization to leverage the top researchers within **field robotics** domain, and extending the current boundaries for real-world robotic applications. We are combined with the top-researchers abround the world, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

## Our Abilities

MetaSLAM provides the following core approaches:

* **Multi-sensor Fusion based Localization and Navigation**
* **City-scale Map Merging**
* **Large-scale indoor Navigation**
* **Multi-agent Cooperation and Exploration**
* **Lifelong Perception and Navigation**

Based on the above abilities, we hope MetaSLAM can benefit for more researchers in different kinds of filed robotic areas.
