# About MetaSLAM

MetaSLAM is a collective intelligence framework for multi-agent systems under large-scale and long-term opeartion, which includes the current cutting-edge **localization**, **mapping**, **exploration** approaches.
 MetaSLAM is also a joint organization to leverage the top researchers within **field robotics** domain, and extending the current boundaries for real-world robotic applications. We are combined with the top-researchers abround the world, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

## Our Mission

MetaSLAM provides the following core approaches:

* **Multi-sensor Fusion based UAV Localization and Navigation.**
* **City-scale Map Merging.**
* **Large-scale indoor 360cam Navigation.**
* **Multi-agent Cooperation.**
* **Lifelong Learning for Long-term Perception.**
