  abstract={We present BioSLAM, a lifelong SLAM framework for learning various new appearances incrementally and maintaining accurate place recognition for previously visited areas. Unlike humans, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting and may forget the previously visited areas when trained with new arrivals. For humans, researchers discover that there exists a memory replay mechanism in the brain to keep the neuron active for previous events. Inspired by this discovery, BioSLAM designs a gated generative replay to control the robot's learning behavior based on the feedback rewards. Specifically, BioSLAM provides a novel dual-memory mechanism for maintenance: 1) a dynamic memory to efficiently learn new observations and 2) a static memory to balance new-old knowledge. When combined with a visual-/LiDAR- based SLAM system, the complete processing pipeline can help the agent incrementally update the place recognition ability, robust to the increasing complexity of long-term place recognition. We demonstrate BioSLAM in two incremental SLAM scenarios. In the first scenario, a LiDAR-based agent continuously travels through a city-scale environment with a 120km trajectory and encounters different types of 3D geometries (open streets, residential areas, commercial buildings). We show that BioSLAM can incrementally update the agent's place recognition ability and outperform the state-of-the-art incremental approach, Generative Replay, by 24%. In the second scenario, a LiDAR-vision-based agent repeatedly travels through a campus-scale area on a 4.5km trajectory. BioSLAM can guarantee the place recognition accuracy to outperform 15\% over the state-of-the-art approaches under different appearances. To our knowledge, BioSLAM is the first memory-enhanced lifelong SLAM system to help incremental place recognition in long-term navigation tasks.}

  abstract={The visual camera is an attractive device in beyond
  visual line of sight (B-VLOS) drone operation, since they are
  low in size, weight, power, and cost, and can provide redun-

  localization algorithms are unable to match visual data that
  have a significantly different appearance due to illuminations or
  viewpoints. This paper presents iSimLoc, a condition/viewpoint
  consistent hierarchical global re-localization approach. The place
  features of iSimLoc can be utilized to search target images
  under changing appearances and viewpoints. Additionally, our
  hierarchical global re-localization module refines in a coarse-to-
  fine manner, allowing iSimLoc to perform a fast and accurate esti-
  mation. We evaluate our method on one dataset with appearance
  variations and one dataset that focuses on demonstrating large-
  scale matching over a long flight in complicated environments. On
  our two datasets, iSimLoc achieves 88.7% and 83.8% successful
  retrieval rates with 1.5s inferencing time, compared to 45.8%

  abstract={We present AutoMerge, a LiDAR data processing framework for assembling a large number of map segments into a complete map. Traditional large-scale map merging methods are fragile to incorrect data associations, and are primarily limited to working only offline. AutoMerge utilizes multi-perspective fusion and adaptive loop closure detection for accurate data associations, and it uses incremental merging to assemble large maps from individual trajectory segments given in random order and with no initial estimations. Furthermore, after assembling the segments, AutoMerge performs fine matching and pose-graph optimization to globally smooth the merged map. We demonstrate AutoMerge on both city-scale merging (120km) and campus-scale repeated merging (4.5km x 8). The experiments show that AutoMerge (i) surpasses the second- and third- best methods by 14% and 24% recall in segment retrieval, (ii) achieves comparable 3D mapping accuracy for 120 km large-scale map assembly, (iii) and it is robust to temporally-spaced revisits. To the best of our knowledge, AutoMerge is the first mapping approach that can merge hundreds of kilometers of individual segments without the aid of GPS.}

  abstract={Place recognition is the fundamental module that

  loop-closure detection and re-localization for long-term navigation. The place recognition community has made astonishing

  this work, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that target longterm localization and discuss future directions and opportunities.
  We start by investigating the formulation of place recognition
  in long-term autonomy and the major challenges in real-world environments. We then review the recent works in place recognition
  for different sensor modalities and current strategies for dealing
  with various place recognition challenges. Finally, we review
  the existing datasets for long-term localization and introduce
  our datasets and evaluation API for different approaches. This
  paper can be a tutorial for researchers new to the place

The ground truth position for both tracks are provided on each trajectory, which is obtained from the Global Position System with an additional General ICP based point cloud refinement.

  year={2022},
  abstract={LiDAR-based localization approach is a fundamental module for large-scale navigation tasks, such as last-mile delivery and autonomous driving, and localization robustness highly relies on viewpoints and 3D feature extraction. Our previous work provides a viewpoint-invariant descriptor to deal with viewpoint differences; however, the global descriptor suffers from a low signal-noise ratio in unsupervised clustering, reducing the distinguishable feature extraction ability. We develop SphereVLAD++, an attention-enhanced viewpoint invariant place recognition method in this work. SphereVLAD++ projects the point cloud on the spherical perspective for each unique area and captures the contextual connections between local features and their dependencies with global 3D geometry distribution. In return, clustered elements within the global descriptor are conditioned on local and global geometries and support the original viewpoint-invariant property of SphereVLAD. In the experiments, we evaluated the localization performance of SphereVLAD++ on both public KITTI360 datasets and self-generated datasets from the city of Pittsburgh. The experiment results show that SphereVLAD++ outperforms all relative state-of-the-art 3D place recognition methods under small or even totally reversed viewpoint differences and shows 0.69% and 15.81% successful retrieval rates with better than the second best. Low computation requirements and high time efficiency also help its application for low-cost robots.}

However, the existing approaches usually lead to unsatisfactory accuracy, which is critical for autonomous robots. In this paper, we propose FusionDepth, a novel two-stage network to advance the self-supervised monocular dense depth learning by leveraging low-cost sparse (e.g. 4-beam) LiDAR. Unlike the existing methods that use sparse LiDAR mainly in a manner of time-consuming iterative post-processing, our model fuses monocular image features and sparse LiDAR features to predict initial depth maps. Then, an efficient feed-forward refine network is further designed to correct the errors in these initial depth maps in pseudo-3D space with real-time performance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as well as the sparse-LiDAR-based methods on both self-supervised monocular depth prediction and completion tasks. With the accurate dense depth prediction, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art sparse-LiDAR-based method (Pseudo-LiDAR++) by more than 68% for the downstream task monocular 3D object detection on the KITTI Leaderboard.},

  author={Lai, Haowen and Yin, Peng and Scherer, Sebastian},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.11739},
  year={2021},
  abstract={Recent years have witnessed the increasing application of place recognition in various environments, such as city roads, large buildings, and a mix of indoor and outdoor places. This task, however, still remains challenging due to the limitations of different sensors and the changing appearance of environments. Current works only consider the use of individual sensors, or simply combine different sensors, ignoring the fact that the importance of different sensors varies as the environment changes. In this paper, an adaptive weighting visual-LiDAR fusion method, named AdaFusion, is proposed to learn the weights for both images and point cloud features. Features of these two modalities are thus contributed differently according to the current environmental situation. The learning of weights is achieved by the attention branch of the network, which is then fused with the multi-modality feature extraction branch. Furthermore, to better utilize the potential relationship between images and point clouds, we design a twostage fusion approach to combine the 2D and 3D attention. Our work is tested on two public datasets, and experiments show that the adaptive weights help improve recognition accuracy and system robustness to varying environments.},

  To alleviate manual efforts, we propose GIDSeg, a novel approach that can simultaneously learn segmentation from sparse annotations via reasoning global-regional structures and individual-vicinal properties.
  GIDSeg depicts global- and individual- relation via a dynamic edge convolution network coupled with a kernelized identity descriptor.
  The ensemble effects are obtained by endowing a fine-grained receptive field to a low-resolution voxelized map.

  Our method can match equirectangular images to the 3D range projections by extracting cross-domain symmetric place descriptors.
  Our key insight is to retain condition-invariant 3D geometry features from limited data samples while eliminating the condition-related features by a designed Generative Adversarial Network.
  Based on such features, we further design a spherical convolution network to learn viewpoint-invariant symmetric place descriptors.
  We evaluate our method on extensive self-collected datasets, which involve \textit{Long-term} (variant appearance conditions), \textit{Large-scale} (up to 2km structure/unstructured environment), and \textit{Multistory} (four-floor confined space).
  Our method surpasses other current state-of-the-arts by achieving around 3 times higher place retrievals to inconsistent environments, and above 3 times accuracy on online localization.

  abstract={Accurate localization on autonomous driving cars is essential for autonomy and driving safety, especially for complex urban streets and search-and-rescue subterranean environments where high-accurate GPS is not available. However current odometry estimation may introduce the drifting problems in long-term navigation without robust global localization. The main challenges involve scene divergence under the interference of dynamic environments and effective perception of observation and object layout variance from different viewpoints. To tackle these challenges, we present PSE-Match, a viewpoint-free place recognition method based on parallel semantic analysis of isolated semantic attributes from 3D point-cloud models. Compared with the original point cloud, the observed variance of semantic attributes is smaller. PSE-Match incorporates a divergence place learning network to capture different semantic attributes parallelly through the spherical harmonics domain. Using both existing benchmark datasets and two in-field collected datasets, our experiments show that the proposed method achieves above 70% average recall with top one retrieval and above 95% average recall with top ten retrieval cases. And PSE-Match has also demonstrated an obvious generalization ability with a limited training dataset.},

  abstract={Safe human-robot interaction requires robots endowed with perception. This paper presents the design of a multi-modal sensory array for continuum robots, targeting operation in semi-structured confined spaces with human users. Active safety measures are enabled via sensory arrays capable of simultaneous sensing of proximity, contact, and force. Proximity sensing is achieved using time-of-flight sensors, while contact force is sensed using Hall effect sensors and embedded magnets. The paper presents the design and fabrication of these sensors, the communication protocol and multiplexing scheme used to allow an interactive rate of communication with a high-level controller, and an evaluation of these sensors for actively mapping the shape of the environment and compliance control using gestures and contact with the robot. Characterization of the proximity sensors is presented with considerations of sensitivity to lighting, color, and texture conditions. Also, characterization of the force sensing is presented. The results show that the multi-modal sensory array can enable pre and post-collision active safety measures and can also enable user interaction with the robot. We believe this new technology allows for increased safety for human-robot interaction in confined and semi-structures spaces due to its demonstrated capabilities of detecting impending collision and mapping the environment along the length of the robot. Future miniaturization of the electronics will also allow possible integration in smaller continuum and soft robots.},

SeqSLAM uses a brute-force sequential matching method, which is computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce a multi-resolution sampling-based global visual place recognition method (MRS-VPR), which can significantly improve the matching efficiency and accuracy in sequential matching. The novelty of this method lies in the coarse-to-fine searching pipeline and a particle filter-based global sampling scheme, that can balance the matching efficiency and accuracy in the long-term navigation task. Moreover, our model works much better than SeqSLAM when the testing sequence is over a much smaller time scale than the reference sequence. Our experiments demonstrate that MRSVPR is efficient in locating short temporary trajectories within long-term reference ones without compromising on the accuracy compared to SeqSLAM.},

Most VPR methods try to improve the place recognition performance by ignoring the environmental factors, leading to decreased accuracy decreases when environmental conditions change significantly, such as day versus night. To this end, we propose an end-to-end conditional visual place recognition method. Specifically, we introduce the multi-domain feature learning method (MDFL) to capture multiple attribute-descriptions for a given place, and then use a feature detaching module to separate the environmental condition-related features from those that are not. The only label required within this feature learning pipeline is the environmental condition. Evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on the multi-season \textit{NORDLAND} dataset, and the multi-weather \textit{GTAV} dataset.

abstract={Loop C losure Detection (LCD) is the essential module in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) task. In the current appearance-based SLAM methods, the visual inputs are usually affected by illumination, appearance and viewpoints changes. Comparing to the visual inputs, with the active property, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based point-cloud inputs are invariant to the illumination and appearance changes. In this paper, we extract 3D voxel maps and 2D top view maps from LiDAR inputs, and the former could capture the local geometry into a simplified 3D voxel format, the later could capture the local road structure into a 2D image format. However, the most challenge problem is to obtain efficient features from 3D and 2D maps to against the viewpoints difference. In this paper, we proposed a synchronous adversarial feature learning method for the LCD task, which could learn the higher level abstract features from different domains without any label data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to extract multi-domain adversarial features for the LCD task in real time. To investigate the performance, we test the proposed method on the KITTI odometry dataset. The extensive experiments results show that, the proposed method could largely improve LCD accuracy even under huge viewpoints differences.},

  abstract={Point cloud based place recognition is still an open issue due to the difficulty in extracting local features from the raw 3D point cloud and generating the global descriptor, and it's even harder in the large-scale dynamic environments. In this paper, we develop a novel deep neural network, named LPD-Net (Large-scale Place Description Network), which can extract discriminative and generalizable global descriptors from the raw 3D point cloud. Two modules, the adaptive local feature extraction module and the graph-based neighborhood aggregation module, are proposed, which contribute to extract the local structures and reveal the spatial distribution of local features in the large-scale point cloud, with an end-to-end manner. We implement the proposed global descriptor in solving point cloud based retrieval tasks to achieve the large-scale place recognition. Comparison results show that our LPD-Net is much better than PointNetVLAD and reaches the state-of-the-art. We also compare our LPD-Net with the vision-based solutions to show the robustness of our approach to different weather and light conditions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Place recognition is one of the major challenges for the LiDAR-based effective localization and mapping task. Traditional methods are usually relying on geometry matching to achieve place recognition, where a global geometry map need to be restored. In this paper, we accomplish the place recognition task based on an end-to-end feature learning framework with the LiDAR inputs. This method consists of two core modules, a dynamic octree mapping module that generates local 2D maps with the consideration of the robot's motion; and an unsupervised place feature learning module which is an improved adversarial feature learning network with additional assistance for the long-term place recognition requirement. More specially, in place feature learning, we present an additional Generative Adversarial Network with a designed Conditional Entropy Reduction module to stabilize the feature learning process in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate the proposed method on the Kitti dataset and North Campus Long-Term LiDAR dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art in place recognition tasks under long-term applications. What's more, the feature size and inference efficiency in the proposed method are applicable in real-time performance on practical robotic platforms.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the main applications of mobile robots is the large-scale perception of the outdoor environment. One of the main challenges of this application is fusing environmental data obtained by multiple robots, especially heterogeneous robots. This paper proposes an enhanced iterative closest point (ICP) method for the fast and accurate registration of 3D environmental models. First, a hierarchical searching scheme is combined with the octree-based ICP algorithm. Second, an early-warning mechanism is used to perceive the local minimum problem. Third, a heuristic escape scheme based on sampled potential transformation vectors is used to avoid local minima and achieve optimal registration. Experiments involving one unmanned aerial vehicle and one unmanned surface vehicle were conducted to verify the proposed technique. The experimental results were compared with those of normal ICP registration algorithms to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.},
