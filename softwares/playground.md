## City-scale Simulation Environments

To provide the best user experience, we provide the simulation platform for multi-agent exploration under city-scale environments. The proposd system contains the major urban areas of city of pittsbugh, and the campus area of carnegie mellon university. Our simulation system will mainly contains:

* The simulated 3D enviroments;
* 360cam image and LiDAR scans;
* Multi-Agent exploration baseline;
* Multi-Agent Mapping baseline;
