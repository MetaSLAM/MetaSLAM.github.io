**Dataset for Test and Evaluation Tools will be released at 5th August**

## Competition Background

From decades, place recognition has been applied to a range of localization and navigation tasks, but only a few methods have been proposed for large scale map assembling. On the other hand, with the development of autonomous driving, last mile delivery and multi agent cooperation, there is a huge demand for efficient and accurate large scale, crowd-sourced map updating. In this competition, General Place Recognition (GPR) for Autonomous Map Assembling, we provide a comprehensive evaluation platform of large scale LiDAR/IMU datasets, repeatedly collected at different times in a variety of environments (city/park/indoor), with varying overlaps. The target is to assemble the joint large scale map based mainly on the place recognition ability without any GPS assistance.

* 10 trajectories including 80 real-world sequences collected from campus of Carnegie Mellon University
* For each trajectory, we traversed 8 times including 2 forward sequences and 2 backward sequences during day-light and 2 forward and 2 backward sequences during night-light.

## Dataset for Test (Groud Truth Provided)

* For each selected trajectory, two forward sequences and one backward sequence will be provided. 
* For each sequence within the same trajectory, the intra-poses and inter-poses are provided.
